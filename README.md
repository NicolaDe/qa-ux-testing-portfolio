## UI Automation Testing Project

This is a practical project where I use automation to test login, withdrawal and deposit features of a Banking Web Application.
 
Within the [cypress-script](https://github.com/nicola-deb/software-testing-portfolio/tree/main/Automation_Testing/cypress-script) folder, you will find a test script that uses the Cypress front-end testing tool, based on JavaScript. 

Within the [selenium-script](https://github.com/nicola-deb/software-testing-portfolio/tree/main/Automation_Testing/selenium-script) folder, you will find a test script that uses the Selenium test automation tool, based on Java in this instance. 


## REST API Project

This is a practical project where I use Visual Studio IDE, Javascript, Postman and Jmeter to set up and test a simple REST API locally:

- Postman REST API Testing Tool tests the POST, GET, PUT and DELETE http requests to manage a collection of users, and
- JMeter Performance Testing Tool tests the simulation of multiple concurrent users creating accounts at the same time.
