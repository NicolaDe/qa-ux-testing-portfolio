## Automation Coding Project

This is a practical project where I use automation to test login, withdrawal and deposit features of a Banking Web Application.
 
Within the [cypress-script](https://github.com/nicola-deb/qa-testing-portfolio/tree/main/test-automation/cypress-script) folder, you will find a test script that uses the Cypress front-end testing tool, based on JavaScript. Cypress' architecture allows tests to run directly inside the browser, which enables a faster execution of test results.

Within the [selenium-script](https://github.com/nicola-deb/qa-testing-portfolio/tree/main/test-automation/selenium-script) folder, you will find a test script that uses the Selenium test automation tool, based on Java in this instance. 
Selenium's architecture allows tests to run across multiple browsers and environments by communicating with web drivers, enabling greater flexibility and compatibility for test automation.


## Defect Reporting 

*What makes a good Bug Report?* 

Jira is my Defect Management tool of choice. And although the tool automatically handles the generation of many of the fields we need to consider when writing a good bug report, we shouldn't take this for granted. It is important to understand how to write a bug report that provides meaningful information for the person reviewing it whether that is:
- the Developer analysing and designing the fix
- the Project Manager who needs to track and/or understand how severely it impacts the product and the project timelines.
- the QA team who can perform Fault-Slip Analysis on the issue to improve testing processes to potentially find similar issues earlier.

*The ISTQB standard of a Bug Report includes:*

- Unique identifier 
- Title with a short summary of the anomaly being reported 
- Date when the anomaly was observed, and author, including their role  
- Identification of the test object and test environment 
- Context of the defect (e.g., test case being run, test activity being performed, SDLC phase, and other relevant information such as the test technique, checklist or test data being used) 
- Description of the failure to enable reproduction and resolution including the test steps that detected the anomaly, and any relevant test logs, database dumps, screenshots, or recordings 
- Expected results and actual results 
- Severity of the defect (degree of impact) on the interests of stakeholders or requirements 
- Priority to fix 
- Status of the defect (e.g., open, deferred, duplicate, waiting to be fixed, awaiting confirmation testing, re-opened, closed, rejected) 
- References (e.g., to the test case that revealed the issue)
