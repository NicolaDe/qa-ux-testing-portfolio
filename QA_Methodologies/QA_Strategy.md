A QA strategy is a structured plan that outlines the processes, tools, and methodologies used to ensure software quality. It defines how testing will be conducted to meet business and technical requirements.

✅ Testing Objectives – What the team aims to achieve (e.g., defect detection, performance validation).
✅ Test Scope – What will be tested (features, integrations, performance, security).
✅ Testing Types – Functional, non-functional, automation, regression, security, etc.
✅ Test Approach – Manual vs. automated testing, risk-based testing, exploratory testing.
✅ Tools & Environments – Selecting test management tools (e.g., Jira, Selenium, Postman).
✅ Defect Management – How issues will be reported, tracked, and resolved.
✅ Test Metrics & Reporting – KPIs to measure effectiveness (e.g., defect density, test coverage).

A well-defined QA strategy helps in delivering high-quality software efficiently and aligning testing efforts with business goals.



##The Principles of Testing

The ISTQB (International Software Testing Qualifications Board) defines 7 fundamental testing principles to improve the effectiveness of software testing.

1️⃣ Testing Shows the Presence of Defects, Not Their Absence
📌 What It Means: Testing reduces the number of defects but can never guarantee a 100% bug-free product.

2️⃣ Exhaustive Testing is Impossible
📌 What It Means: It's impractical to test every possible input/output scenario. Instead, we use risk-based testing and prioritization.

3️⃣ Early Testing Saves Time & Money
📌 What It Means: Detecting defects early in the development lifecycle (Shift-Left Testing) is cheaper and prevents larger failures later.

4️⃣ Defects Cluster Together (Pareto Principle - 80/20 Rule)
📌 What It Means: Most defects are found in a small portion of the application (e.g., 20% of modules cause 80% of bugs). Prioritize testing in high-risk areas.

5️⃣ Beware of the Pesticide Paradox
📌 What It Means: Running the same set of tests repeatedly eventually stops finding new defects. To overcome this, test cases should be updated and varied.

6️⃣ Testing is Context-Dependent
📌 What It Means: Different applications require different testing approaches (e.g., security testing for banking apps, usability testing for e-commerce).

7️⃣ Absence of Errors is a Fallacy
📌 What It Means: A system can be bug-free but still fail if it doesn’t meet user needs. Testing should focus on validating business requirements as well as finding defects.
