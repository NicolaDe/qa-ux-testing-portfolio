## Defect Reporting 

*What makes a good Bug Report?* 

Jira is my Defect Management tool of choice. And although the tool automatically handles the generation of many of the fields we need to consider when writing a good bug report, we shouldn't take this for granted. It is important to understand how to write a bug report that provides meaningful information for the person reviewing it whether that is:
- the Developer analysing and designing the fix
- the Project Manager who needs to track and/or understand how severely it impacts the product and the project timelines.
- the QA team who can perform Fault-Slip Analysis on the issue to improve testing processes to potentially find similar issues earlier.

*The ISTQB standard of a Bug Report includes:*

- Unique identifier 
- Title with a short summary of the anomaly being reported 
- Date when the anomaly was observed, and author, including their role  
- Identification of the test object and test environment 
- Context of the defect (e.g., test case being run, test activity being performed, SDLC phase, and other relevant information such as the test technique, checklist or test data being used) 
- Description of the failure to enable reproduction and resolution including the test steps that detected the anomaly, and any relevant test logs, database dumps, screenshots, or recordings 
- Expected results and actual results 
- Severity of the defect (degree of impact) on the interests of stakeholders or requirements 
- Priority to fix 
- Status of the defect (e.g., open, deferred, duplicate, waiting to be fixed, awaiting confirmation testing, re-opened, closed, rejected) 
- References (e.g., to the test case that revealed the issue)
