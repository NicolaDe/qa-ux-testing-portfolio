Quality Assurance isn’t just a set of tools or processes - it’s a mindset, and a culture that the whole company has to buy-in to in order for quality assurance to be upheld throughout the Software Development Lifecycle.

What's important when creating a culture of Quality Assurance?

1. Communicating the "why" and "how" to the development teams before implementing changes to tools and/or processes. 
2. Build trust around the introduction of new processes and tools - intent is complementary, not competitive. 
3. Pair programming between QA Engineers and Developers - shared stategy and goal of creating a high-quality product. :wq!
